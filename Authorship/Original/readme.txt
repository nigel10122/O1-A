Abstract:
This research paper presents a comparative case study analyzing performance, design trade-offs, and output quality across major generative AI conversational systems including OpenAI GPT, Google Bard, and Anthropic Claude. Through structured prompts, scoring frameworks, and architectural review, the paper evaluates how each system handles contextual integrity, hallucination control, user safety, and multilingual reasoning. The study highlights key implications for future LLM deployment in enterprise and consumer domains.
